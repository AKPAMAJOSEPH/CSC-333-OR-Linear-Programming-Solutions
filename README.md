 Linear Programming Solutions for CSC-333

**Welcome to Your Optimization Toolkit!**

This repository is your one-stop shop for mastering **Linear Programming (LP)**. Here, you'll learn how to apply optimization techniques to solve real-world problems. Whether you're maximizing profits, minimizing costs, or efficiently allocating resources, we've got you covered!

---


**What's Inside?**

This repository contains a series of problems that demonstrate the power of linear programming. We’ll break down each one step-by-step to ensure it's easy to follow.


 **Problem Areas We Cover:**

- **Production Planning**: Optimizing production schedules to maximize profit.
- **Resource Allocation**: Distributing resources effectively to achieve maximum benefit.
- **Transportation & Logistics**: Minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency in transportation networks.
- **Financial Analysis**: Making smart financial decisions through optimization.
- **Marketing & Advertising**: Maximizing the return on investment for marketing campaigns.

Each problem will guide you through:
1. **Formulating the Problem**: Defining decision variables, constraints, and the objective function.
2. **Visualization**: Plotting the problem and its feasible region to help you better understand the scenario.
3. **Solving the Problem**: Using Python libraries like `scipy` or `pulp` to find the optimal solution.
4. **Interpreting Results**: Analyzing the results to derive meaningful insights.

**Getting Started**

Follow these simple steps to begin exploring and solving optimization problems!


 1. **Install Python and Required Libraries**

Before you can run the code, ensure that Python and the necessary libraries are installed:

- **Download Python**: [Install Python from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Install Libraries**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pulp
```

These libraries will help us with numerical calculations, graphing, and solving linear programming problems.

### 2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**

Once you've installed the required libraries, follow these steps to open the Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Navigate to the project directory**: Open a terminal/command prompt and go to the folder where the `CSC-333-OR-Linear-Programming-Solutions.ipynb` file is located.
   
2. **Launch Jupyter**: Type the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook interface:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open a web browser where you can select and open the `CSC-333-OR-Linear-Programming-Solutions.ipynb` file.


 3. **Explore the Notebook**

The notebook is structured to help you learn the process of solving linear programming problems. Here's what each section covers:

- **Problem Formulation**: Each section begins by defining the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints for that problem.
- **Visualization**: Using `matplotlib`, we’ll graph the constraints, feasible regions, and level curves of the objective function to help you visualize the solution.
- **Solving the Problem**: We’ll use Python's `scipy` or `pulp` to solve the linear programming problem and find the optimal values of the decision variables.
- **Interpreting Results**: After solving the problem, we’ll interpret the results and discuss their implications in real-world terms.


 4. **Running the Code**

To run the code:

- Open the notebook and **run each cell in sequence**.
- The notebook will display graphs and optimal solutions for each problem.

5. **Experimenting with Different Scenarios**

Feel free to modify the variables in each problem to test different scenarios. For example, change the available resources, profits, or costs to see how the solution changes. You can adjust these values directly in the notebook and run the cells again to see the new results.

**Methodology**

In this notebook, we use linear programming to optimize various scenarios. The process is broken down as follows:

1. **Formulation**: Each problem begins by defining the decision variables, the objective function (what we want to maximize or minimize), and the constraints (the limitations or restrictions we face).
   
2. **Graphing**: To help visualize the problem, we plot the constraints and feasible region using `matplotlib`. This provides a clear understanding of the problem and helps you identify where the optimal solution lies.

3. **Solving the LP Problem**: Once the problem is graphically represented, we use Python’s `scipy.optimize.linprog` (or `pulp` library) to solve the linear programming problem. These tools help us find the optimal values for the decision variables that either maximize or minimize the objective function.

4. **Interpreting the Results**: Finally, we interpret the results based on the solution found by the solver. For example, if we’re maximizing profit, we’ll discuss how much of each product to produce to achieve the maximum profit.

**Let's Optimize Together!**

Feel free to modify the code and try different inputs to explore various optimization scenarios. If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out. Linear programming is a powerful tool for decision-making, and I'm excited to help you get the most out of it.

**Happy Optimizing!**
